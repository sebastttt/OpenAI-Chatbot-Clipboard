**OpenAI Chatbot Clipboard**
This is a Python script that uses OpenAI's API to create a chatbot that interacts with the clipboard. The script listens for a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+X by default) and sends the selected text in the clipboard to OpenAI to generate a response. The response is then copied back to the clipboard, and the NumLock key is pressed to simulate a notification.

**Requirements**
To use this script, you'll need to have the following installed:

Python 3.x
The OpenAI library (openai)
The Pyperclip library (pyperclip)
The Keyboard library (keyboard)
The PyAutoGUI library (pyautogui)
You'll also need an OpenAI API key to use the chatbot. You can sign up for an API key on the OpenAI website.

**Usage**
To use the script, simply run the openai_chatbot_clipboard.py file in your terminal or IDE. The script will start listening for the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+X by default), and you can trigger it by selecting some text and pressing the shortcut. The chatbot will generate a response based on the selected text, and the response will be copied back to the clipboard. The NumLock key will also be pressed to simulate a notification.
